This project was done by TEMA, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Aveiro, Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores - Microssistemas e Nanotecnologia (Portugal), and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Trent University (Canada), and was gratefully acknowledged by The Horizon Europe (HORIZON), HORIZON-MSCA-2023-PF-01, Grant101149632â€“GDSNL, project UID 00481 Centre for Mechanical Technology and Automation (TEMA), and project CarboNCT, 2022.03596.PTDC (DOI: 10.54499/2022.03596.PTDC).

This program consists of three main parts:
1. Data
2. Python code
3. Origin drawing

The data of the four processes were analyzed in Figures 3 to 6 and 13 to 16 in the literature, the diamond vacancy color centers (DVCC) diameter of HPHT, the DVCC Plasma power of MPCVD, the DVCC annealing time after ion implantation, and the DVCC annealing time after electron irradiation. 
Data source for Machine Learning Task I-30 Excel files. At the same time, it also includes the data source Task II for DWF analysis-15 Excel files;

Origin drawing only includes statistical analysis of DWF data in .opju format - extracted ZPL data violin analysis;

Python code includes a total of 12 Python files for Task I and Task II;
