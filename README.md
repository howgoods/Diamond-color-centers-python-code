This project was done by TEMA, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Aveiro, Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores - Microssistemas e Nanotecnologia and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Trent University, and was gratefully acknowledged by The Horizon Europe (HORIZON), HORIZON-MSCA-2023-PF-01, Grant101149632â€“GDSNL, project UID 00481 Centre for Mechanical Technology and Automation (TEMA) and project CarboNCT, 2022.03596.PTDC (DOI: 10.54499/2022.03596.PTDC).

This program consists of three main parts:
1. Data
2. Python code
3. Origin drawing

The data includes the center size of HPHT diamond color centers for four DVCC processes analyzed in Figures 3 to 6 and 13 to 16 in the literature, the power of MPCVD, the annealing time after ion implantation, and the annealing time after electron irradiation. Data source for machine learning Task I-30 excel files. At the same time, it also includes the data source Task II for DWF analysis-15 Excel files;

Origin drawing only includes statistical analysis of DWF data in .opju format;

Python code includes a total of 12 py files for Task I and Task II;
